#### VirtualTag #################################################
#
#     VirtualTag is a nametag plug-in designed for the modern
# Minecraft version. It works at the data packet layer, so it
# will not affect the existing scoreboard.
#
# Enjoy it :)
#################################################################

# General Settings
general:
  # Set how often VirtualTag updates the player's NameTag (ticks)
  # This is very useful when there are placeholders in the nametag
  # But you don’t have to worry about frequent updates that will
  # take up bandwidth, because the plugin will only send packets
  # after the player’s nametag is actually changed.
  update_interval: 20

  # If the player has multiple NameTags, should they be displayed at the same time?
  # For example, if a player is both an [Admin] and a [VIP], then enabling this
  # option will show his two nametags at the same time: [Admin][Vip]
  # Note that final nametag will be sorted according to the priority
  multiple_name_tags: false

# NameTag Group Settings
groups:
  default:
    permission: ''
    priority: 0
    prefix: ''
    suffix: '%javascript_smallreptxt%'
